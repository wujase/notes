# Designing a Hotel Management System

A Hotel Management System is a software built to handle all online hotel activities easily and safely. This System will give the hotel management power and flexibility to manage the entire system from a single online portal. The system allows the manager to keep track of all the available rooms in the system as well as to book rooms and generate bills.

## Requirements

- The system should support the booking of different room types like standard, deluxe, family suite, etc.
- Guests should be able to search the room inventory and book any available room.
- The system should be able to retrieve information, such as who booked a particular room, or what rooms were booked by a specific customer.
- The system should allow customers to cancel their booking - and provide them with a full refund if the cancelation occurs before 24 hours of the check-in date.
- The system should be able to send notifications whenever the booking is nearing the check-in or check-out date.
- The system should maintain a room housekeeping log to keep track of all housekeeping tasks.
- Any customer should be able to add room services and food items.
- Customers can ask for different amenities.
- The customers should be able to pay their bills through credit card, check or cash.

## Class Diagram

- Hotel and HotelLocation: Our system will support multiple locations of a hotel.
- Room: The basic building block of the system. Every room will be uniquely identified by the room number. Each Room will have attributes like Room Style, Booking Price, etc.
- Account: We will have different types of accounts in the system: one will be a guest to search and book rooms, another will be a receptionist. Housekeeping will keep track of the housekeeping records of a room, and a Server will handle room service.
- RoomBooking: This class will be responsible for managing bookings for a room.
- Notification: Will take care of sending notifications to guests.
- RoomHouseKeeping: To keep track of all housekeeping records for rooms.
- RoomCharge: Encapsulates the details about different types of room services that guests have requested.
- Invoice: Contains different invoice-items for every charge against the room.
- RoomKey: Each room can be assigned an electronic key card. Keys will have a barcode and will be uniquely identified by a key-ID.

  private String id;
  private String password;
  private AccountStatus status;

  public boolean resetPassword();
}

public abstract class Person {
  private String name;
  private Address address;
