# Designing a Restaurant Management system

A Restaurant Management System is a software built to handle all restaurant activities in an easy and safe manner. This System will give the Restaurant management power and flexibility to manage the entire system from a single portal. The system allows the manager to keep track of available tables in the system as well as the reservation of tables and bill generation.

## Requirements

- The restaurant will have different branches.
- Each restaurant branch will have a menu.
- The menu will have different menu sections, containing different menu items.
- The waiter should be able to create an order for a table and add meals for each seat.
- Each meal can have multiple meal items. Each meal item corresponds to a menu item.
- The system should be able to retrieve information about tables currently available to seat walk-in customers.
- The system should support the reservation of tables.
- The receptionist should be able to search for available tables by date/time and reserve a table.
- The system should allow customers to cancel their reservation.
- The system should be able to send notifications whenever the reservation time is approaching.
- The customers should be able to pay their bills through credit card, check or cash.
- Each restaurant branch can have multiple seating arrangements of tables.

## Class Diagram

- Restaurant: This class represents a restaurant. Each restaurant has registered employees. The employees are part of the restaurant because if the restaurant becomes inactive, all its employees will automatically be deactivated.
- Branch: Any restaurants can have multiple branches. Each branch will have its own set of employees and menus.
- Menu: All branches will have their own menu.
- MenuSection and MenuItem: A menu has zero or more menu sections. Each menu section consists of zero or more menu items.
- Table and TableSeat: The basic building block of the system. Every table will have a unique identifier, maximum sitting capacity, etc. Each table will have multiple seats.
- Order: This class encapsulates the order placed by a customer.
- Meal: Each order will consist of separate meals for each table seat.
- Meal Item: Each Meal will consist of one or more meal items corresponding to a menu item.
- Account: Weâ€™ll have different types of accounts in the system, one will be a receptionist to search and reserve tables and the other, the waiter will place orders in the system.
- Notification: Will take care of sending notifications to customers.
- Bill: Contains different bill-items for every meal item.
